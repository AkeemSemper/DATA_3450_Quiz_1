    "For this assignment please complete the directed code segments below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that when names for functions, files, etc... are specified, that you use the directed value, including capitalization and spaces. The submission system on GitHub looks for specific values, and if yours do not match, your code will fail. The pieces that are graded are labled with #AUTOGRADED in the code segment, outside of providing what is asked for there, you are free to build pretty much any other code that helps you - it may be useful to preview data, print out values, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "You may call external functions and import external code if you find it useful, except if you are explicitly directed to code something yourself - e.g. if you are asked to calculate the average of a set of numbers, you do not need to write code to loop through each value to add them up and divide, you can use a prebuilt average function. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can add any other stuff you need or that you find helpful - code blocks, exploration, charts, etc... as long as the function returns the right answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to do all of this stuff. Focus first on what the goal is, then try to break it into logical steps, then try to translate each of those steps into code. If you have things broken down into pieces, each step can be looked up in old code, looked up in the book, or just Googled to find a similar example you can adapt. Getting a correct result is the goal - if you can build code that always returns the correct result, that's good (it might not be the most effetive way to d things, but that is secondary)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please change all of the \"Return 0\" to return your actual answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In the solution checker I set it to automatically allow for 5% tolerance - so thing like slight varaiations in rounding, decimal places, etc... shouldn't cause an issue. The difference one uses an absolute value in checking, so the order of the subtraction won't matter. "
